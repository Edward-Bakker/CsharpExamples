# C# Examples
A solution with various projects that explain techniques related to the C# course on NHL-Stenden Hogeschool the Netherlands. 

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This code is for educational purposes only.

### Prerequisites
- Visual studio 2019
- .NET Core 3.1
- .NET Framework 4.7.2

### Installing
The following steps will get you up and runnning with the example project:
1. Clone the repository with your favourite GIT front-end or CLI.
```
git clone https://github.com/Schmitzenbergh/CsharpExamples.git
```
2. Open the "CsharpExamples" folder and load the "CsharpExamples.sln" solution file.
3. From the solution explorer in Visual Studio, unfold the desired project example OR start a project.

In the end you should have a multitude of projects containing one or more examples regarding the discussed C# topics.

# What examples are available
The following examples are available:
- Asynchronous progamming with tasks
- Delegates and how to use them
- Object Oriented Programming 
- Inheritance
- The LinkedList datastructure (in a baisc form)

## Contributing
We highly recommend every student to contribute examples or improvements to this repository. If you wish to do so, fork and clone the repository and add your changes in a new branch. Then make a pull request explaining what your contribution is. The website [OSSWatch](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/pullrequest) has a nice common workflow that you could use.
A common workflow for submitting a pull request with GitHub would look like this:
1. Create/Log in to your GitHub account
2. Go to the page for the code respository you want to contribute to (the “upstream”)
3. “Fork” the repository (this creates a clone to your GitHub account)
4. Create a local clone of your fork with git clone
5. Create a local branch for your changes
6. Make your changes and commit them to your local branch with git commit, ensuring to include a descriptive commit message
7. Push the branch to your GitHub fork using git push
8. Go to the page for the upstream repository go to the pull requests tab
9. Click the “New Pull Request” Button
10. Select the branch you want to submit, and write a summary of what your change explaining what it is intended to do and how it is implemented
